We all use and see computers every day and hear people say how smart computers are. Actually, computers are not very smart at all! A computer, broken down into its most basic form is nothing more than a bunch of tiny electronic switches, called transistors, that can be set to either a 1 or 0 (on or off, also known as binary). By getting the computer to set these tiny switches on or off in a certain pattern, you can get the computer to actually do something useful, like show a picture on the screen that you have taken. The computer does not know how to do this by itself though.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/overview":{"id":"introduction/overview","title":"Overview","description":"image","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/what-is-programming":{"id":"introduction/what-is-programming","title":"What is programming","description":"Before you can actually start to write programs on a computer to help you solve problems, it would be nice to know what programming really is!
