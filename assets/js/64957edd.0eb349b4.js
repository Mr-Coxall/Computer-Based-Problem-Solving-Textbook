Many years ago, it might have been common but not today. The tools you will learn from this book are good programming techniques. These tools will be useful no matter what programming language you are using. Just like in the real world, you cannot be called a \u201clinguist\u201d if you only know one language. The same thing is true for a programmer; knowing more than one programming language is essential. The fortunate thing is that if you know how to solve problems for a computer and know one programming language, picking up a second one is much easier. The cornerstone of being a good programmer is to be able to solve problems in a logical and systematic way and hopefully have fun in the process."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
