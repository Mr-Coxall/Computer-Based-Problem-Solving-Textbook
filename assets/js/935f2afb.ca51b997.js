Despite the fact that a normal high school semester courses run for about 90 days, you will not become an expert programmer in just one semester. It has been said that it takes around 10,000 hours _ to really become proficient at anything and programming is no different. By the end of this book you will be very much on your way and have a good foundation in the skills you will need. The important thing to remember is that the point is not to teach you a specific programming language, since programming languages come and go and change over time. This is just like real languages.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/introduction":{"id":"introduction/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Cartoon","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/what-is-programming":{"id":"introduction/what-is-programming","title":"What is programming","description":"Before you can actually start to write programs on a computer to help you solve problems, it would be nice to know what programming really is! We all use and see computers every day and hear people say how smart computers are. Actually, computers are not very smart at all! A computer, broken down into its most basic form is nothing more than a bunch of tiny electronic switches, called transistors , that can be set to either a 1 or 0 (on or off, also known as binary ). By getting the computer to set these tiny switches on or off in a certain pattern, you can get the computer to actually do something useful, like show a picture on the screen that you have taken. The computer does not know how to do this by itself though.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"object-oriented-programming/index":{"id":"object-oriented-programming/index","title":"Create a Page","description":"","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"preface":{"id":"preface","title":"Preface","description":"Cartoon","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/index":{"id":"problem-solving/index","title":"Create a Page","description":"","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"structured-problem-solving/index":{"id":"structured-problem-solving/index","title":"Create a Page","description":"","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"structured-problem-solving/variables":{"id":"structured-problem-solving/variables","title":"Variables","description":"A variable  is a name that we use to represent a value that we want the computer to store in its memory for us. When solving problems, we often need to hold some valuable pieces of information we will use in our solution. From the \u201cInput-Process-Output\u201d model above, an example of variables we would be placing in storage is the input from the user. The pieces of information could be people\u2019s names, important numbers or a total in a purchase. We use a name that means something to us (and hopefully the people that come after us and read our source code , commonly referred to as just code) so that we know right away when we read our code what it is holding. In math class you might be familiar with equations that involve variables like \u201cx or y\u201d. We would not name a variable x, if it is holding the number of students in class, we might call it numberOfStudents or numberofstudents (depending on the style guide for a particular language). This has much more meaning to us and other people that also look at our code. Some people are still tempted to use a variable name like \\"x\\", becasue they say it will save space. But once our code is converted to machine language, it does not matter what you called your varaible it will be converted to something that takes the same space. So be a \\"nice\\" programmer and always use meaningful varaible names","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/congratulations":{"id":"tutorial-basics/congratulations","title":"Congratulations","description":"You have just learned the basics of Docusaurus and made some changes to the initial template.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post","title":"Create a Blog Post","description":"Docusaurus creates a page for each blog post, but also a blog index page, a tag system, an RSS feed...","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-document":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-document","title":"Create a Document","description":"Documents are groups of pages connected through:","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-page":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-page","title":"Create a Page","description":"Add Markdown or React files to src/pages to create a standalone page:","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site","title":"Deploy your site A","description":"Docusaurus is a static-site-generator (also called Jamstack).","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/markdown-features":{"id":"tutorial-basics/markdown-features","title":"Markdown Features","description":"Docusaurus supports Markdown and a few additional features.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions":{"id":"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions","title":"Manage Docs Versions","description":"Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site","title":"Translate your site","description":"Let\'s translate docs/intro.md to French.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
