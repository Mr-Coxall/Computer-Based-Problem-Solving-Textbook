We all use and see computers every day and hear people say how smart computers are. Actually, computers are not very smart at all! A computer, broken down into its most basic form is nothing more than a bunch of tiny electronic switches, called transistors, that can be set to either a 1 or 0 (on or off, also known as binary). By getting the computer to set these tiny switches on or off in a certain pattern, you can get the computer to actually do something useful, like show a picture on the screen that you have taken. The computer does not know how to do this by itself though.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions":{"id":"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions","title":"Manage Docs Versions","description":"Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/markdown-features":{"id":"tutorial-extras/markdown-features","title":"Markdown Features","description":"Docusaurus supports Markdown and a few additional features.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site","title":"Translate your site","description":"Let\'s translate docs/intro.md to French.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
