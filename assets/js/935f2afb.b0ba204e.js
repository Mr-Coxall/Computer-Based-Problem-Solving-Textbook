Despite the fact that a normal high school semester courses run for about 90 days, you will not become an expert programmer in just one semester. It has been said that it takes around 10,000 hours to really become proficient at anything and programming is no different. By the end of this book you will be very much on your way and have a good foundation in the skills you will need. The important thing to remember is that the point is not to teach you a specific programming language, since programming languages come and go and change over time. This is just like real languages.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/introduction":{"id":"introduction/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Cartoon","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/what-is-programming":{"id":"introduction/what-is-programming","title":"What is programming","description":"Before you can actually start to write programs on a computer to help you solve problems, it would be nice to know what programming really is! We all use and see computers every day and hear people say how smart computers are. Actually, computers are not very smart at all! A computer, broken down into its most basic form is nothing more than a bunch of tiny electronic switches, called transistors, that can be set to either a 1 or 0 (on or off, also known as binary). By getting the computer to set these tiny switches on or off in a certain pattern, you can get the computer to actually do something useful, like show a picture on the screen that you have taken. The computer does not know how to do this by itself though.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"object-oriented-programming/index":{"id":"object-oriented-programming/index","title":"Create a Page","description":"","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"preface":{"id":"preface","title":"Preface","description":"Cartoon","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/computer-problem-solving":{"id":"problem-solving/computer-problem-solving","title":"Computer Problem Solving","description":"The initial goal of learning problem solving was to help us to solve problems that a computer program could be used for to help solve. The initial six step problem solving model that was presented can be used to help solve any type of problem. If we know that we are going to use a computer program to help solve the problem, the six steps can be translated into six steps that are more tailored for computer programming problems. They are the same basic six steps; they are just more focused on computer programming problems.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/example-problems":{"id":"problem-solving/example-problems","title":"Example Problems","description":"Here are some examples of problems and a possible solution using the six step method. Note that these problems are not necessarily problems that you would use a computer to help you solve. This is an important thing to remember, not all problems should be solved with a computer. Although this book is about solving problems using a computer, there are many problems that are better solved not using a computer and that is perfectly OK. Sometimes your job as a programmer might be to identify that you should not be solving the problem on a computer. Latter on these six steps will be translated into six step used to solve problems that a computer program will be used to help solve.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/flow-charts":{"id":"problem-solving/flow-charts","title":"Flow-Charts","description":"Some people think that there is no need to do `flow-charts before writing a program; that you can just go to the computer and start writing code. Any \u201cinteresting\u201d computer problem is so complex though, that without planning you would just end up spinning your wheels and have to throw out most of your code. In our six step problem solving model, the second step was to create a model and flow-charts are an excellent tool to make a model of what happens in most computer problems. Remember that a computer program is just a set of steps that the computer follows to solve a problem. A flow-chart is just a pictorial representation of a sequence of steps.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/problem-solving":{"id":"problem-solving/problem-solving","title":"Problem Solving","description":"Cartoon","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/pseudo-code":{"id":"problem-solving/pseudo-code","title":"Pseudocode","description":"Pseudocode is a kind of structured English for describing algorithms. Pseudocode allows the designer to focus on the logic of the algorithm without being distracted by details of language syntax. At the same time, the pseudocode needs to be complete. It describes the entire logic of the algorithm so that implementation becomes a rote mechanical task of translating line by line into source code.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/steps-in-problem-solving":{"id":"problem-solving/steps-in-problem-solving","title":"Steps in Problem Solving","description":"There are many ways to solve a problem but having a process to follow can help make problem solving easier. If you do not think through a problem logically, then you end up just going around in circles and never solving it. The following is just one of many Six Step Problem Solving Systems, which can be used to solve any type of problem, not just ones that will be solved on a computer. The good thing is that the system translates nicely to computer problems, which is very useful, since the focus of the book is to solve problems on a computer.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"problem-solving/top-down-design":{"id":"problem-solving/top-down-design","title":"Top Down Design","description":"Top-down design is a method of breaking a problem down into smaller, less complex pieces from the initial overall problem. Most \u201cgood\u201d problems are too complex to solve in just one step, so we divide the problem up into smaller manageable pieces, solve each one of them and then bring everything back together again. The process of making the steps more and more specific in top-down design is called stepwise refinement.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"structured-problem-solving/selection/intro":{"id":"structured-problem-solving/selection/intro","title":"Intro","description":"It should be remembered that the focus of this book is to teach students how to program, not to just teach them one particular programming language. To do this the focus is on \u201cProblem Solving\u201d, using a computer program as a problem solving aid. Programming languages change over time and come and go but a good foundation of programming concepts and how to solve a problem will allow anyone to get over the syntax of a new programming language.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"structured-problem-solving/structured-problem-solving":{"id":"structured-problem-solving/structured-problem-solving","title":"Structured Problem Solving","description":"Cartoon","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"structured-problem-solving/top-down-design":{"id":"structured-problem-solving/top-down-design","title":"Top Down Design in Programming","description":"As we have seen above, top-down design is a process of breaking a complicated problem down into simpler steps that actually can be solved. In programming one of the easiest models to follow for beginner programmers is the Input-Process-Output Model (IPO Model). You are most likely already familiar with this model, even if you do not realize you are using it. In life there are many examples of getting information, doing something with it and then returning the result. The most common example is probable the problems you do in math class every day. You get information, do calculations and then return the answer. We are going to use this model to help us solve our computer problems. The first step in our top-down design will always be to break the problem up into input-process-output.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"structured-problem-solving/variables":{"id":"structured-problem-solving/variables","title":"Variables","description":"A variable is a name that we use to represent a value that we want the computer to store in its memory for us. When solving problems, we often need to hold some valuable pieces of information we will use in our solution. From the \u201cInput-Process-Output\u201d model above, an example of variables we would be placing in storage is the input from the user. The pieces of information could be people\u2019s names, important numbers or a total in a purchase. We use a name that means something to us (and hopefully the people that come after us and read our source code, commonly referred to as just code) so that we know right away when we read our code what it is holding. In math class you might be familiar with equations that involve variables like \u201cx or y\u201d. We would not name a variable x, if it is holding the number of students in class, we might call it numberOfStudents or numberofstudents (depending on the style guide for a particular language). This has much more meaning to us and other people that also look at our code. Some people are still tempted to use a variable name like \\"x\\", becasue they say it will save space. But once our code is converted to machine language, it does not matter what you called your varaible it will be converted to something that takes the same space. So be a \\"nice\\" programmer and always use meaningful varaible names.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/congratulations":{"id":"tutorial-basics/congratulations","title":"Congratulations","description":"You have just learned the basics of Docusaurus and made some changes to the initial template.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post","title":"Create a Blog Post","description":"Docusaurus creates a page for each blog post, but also a blog index page, a tag system, an RSS feed...","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-document":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-document","title":"Create a Document","description":"Documents are groups of pages connected through:","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-page":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-page","title":"Create a Page","description":"Add Markdown or React files to src/pages to create a standalone page:","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site","title":"Deploy your site A","description":"Docusaurus is a static-site-generator (also called Jamstack).","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/markdown-features":{"id":"tutorial-basics/markdown-features","title":"Markdown Features","description":"Docusaurus supports Markdown and a few additional features.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions":{"id":"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions","title":"Manage Docs Versions","description":"Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site","title":"Translate your site","description":"Let\'s translate docs/intro.md to French.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
